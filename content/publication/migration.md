# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In recent years, while Comorian migrants have been at the center of growing social and political tensions in the French island of Mayotte, the academic literature on the subject has remained scant. In this paper, we aim to start building an image of the emigration of Comorians toward Mayotte. Using survey data collected in 2016-2017 in Comoros, we find that migration is more prevalent among the poor. We also find the young and lowly educated are more likely to be willing to migrate to Mayotte. Finally, we find the poor are more likely to migrate for economic reasons, and less likely to return to Comoros voluntarily. These results are largely consistent with existing theories of migrant self-selection."
